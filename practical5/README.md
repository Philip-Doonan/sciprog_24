# Practical 5
This file contains two files fibseq and arctan. This pratical was to
use pointers and to scan in variables. fibseq took in a integrer and gave the fibonacci sequence to that number. While arctan explores two ways of 
computing arctan(x) using Maclaurin series and natural log.

* Compiling fibonacci code with <br>
 gcc -o fibseq fibseq.c<br>

* Run code with<br>
./fibseq<br>

* __Output__<br>
Please enter an integer n<br>
