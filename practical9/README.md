# Practical 9 
This is the final practical for the sciprog module. This practical involved 
reading inputs from files. We were given two code stubs main_stub which reads
in a txt file we were given called not_magic square and one is magic square.
These files were than inputed into the file magic_square stub where it was checked
to see if the rows, columns and diagonals sums were equal. 

* Compiling was done using<br>

gcc -o main_stub main_stub.c -Wall<br>
gcc -o magic_square_stub magic_square_stub.h -Wall<br>

* Then ran using 
./main_stub<br>
Then inputing the name of the file you want to check is a magic square<br>

* __Output__
Enter file name: not_magic_square.txt<br>
No. lines, 3<br>
This is not magic<br>
